<h1> World Happiness Report 2015 Analysis </h1>
-----------------------------------------

This Project's goal is to apply the Big Data Analytic project cycle on the selected dataset(World Happiness Report 2015). In this project, methods and techniques that were seen appropriate for the analsysis were used to get insights about the data. 

<h2> Data Visualization Techniques Used: </h2>
--------------------------------------
1. Scatterplot matrix

2. Barplots

3. Densityplots

4. Boxplots


<h2> Analysis Model Used: </h2> 
----------------------
The linear regression was used to estimate the relationship between two quantitative variables "Economy" and "Happiness Score". Using Linear Regression we were able to conclude there's a strong direct relationship between the two variables.


<b>Perfomance Measures Used:</b>

- Standard Error (SE): the approximate standard deviation of a statistical sample population that  describes the variation between the calculated mean of the population and one which is considered known, or accepted as accurate. The lower the RSE, the better the model.

- P-value: if <0.05, value is significant in identifying relationship
